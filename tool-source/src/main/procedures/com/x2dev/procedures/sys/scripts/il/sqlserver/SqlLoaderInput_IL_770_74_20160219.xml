The SQL Document tag includes the SQL statements that will be executed when the procedure runs.
SQL Statements supported include 

NOTES:
The SQLDocument element cannot be edited using the UI because the validator will fail.  It must be 
uploaded or imported.
The SQL statements supported are {INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE}.
Each SQL Statement to execute is placed in a SQLStatement element.  Generally, SQL should be placed in CDATA sections.
All statements are executed as a single transaction. If one statement fails, no updates occur.
The SQLDocument must include at least one SQLTest.  This element containing a TestStatement and a TestValue is used to verify
that the SQL is being applied to a proper environment. The TestStatement is a select statement that will return 
a single value.  The TestValue is the expected result.  The SQLStatements will not be processed unless there is at least one
SQLTest.  If there are multiple SQLTests, all must pass.
