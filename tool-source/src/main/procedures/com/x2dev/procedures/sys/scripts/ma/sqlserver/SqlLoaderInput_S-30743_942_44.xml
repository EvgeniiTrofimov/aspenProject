     The SQL Document tag includes the SQL statements that will be executed when the procedure runs.
     SQL Statements supported include
     
     NOTES:
     The SQLDocument element cannot be edited using the UI because the validator will fail.  It must be
     uploaded or imported.
     The SQL statements supported are {INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE}.
     Each SQL Statement to execute is placed in a SQLStatement element.  Generally, SQL should be placed in CDATA sections.
     All statements are executed as a single transaction. If one statement fails, no updates occur.
     The SQLDocument must include at least one SQLTest.  This element containing a TestStatement and a TestValue is used to verify
     that the SQL is being applied to a proper environment. The TestStatement is a select statement that will return
     a single value.  The TestValue is the expected result.  The SQLStatements will not be processed unless there is at least one
     SQLTest.  If there are multiple SQLTests, all must pass.
